## How it works

Project replays all known power off sequences that are stored in internal ROM memory to turn off all TVs that are in the range of that device. Playing is triggered on demand by pushing external button.

## How to test

Internal logic needs 8MHz clock (to be generated by RPi Pico or external oscillator).
After pushing button connected to i[0], activity LED on o[1] should start blinking and IR LED on o[0] should emitt power off sequences for over 50 different standards.

## External hardware

NPN transistor driving IR led.
Button with pull up resistor to trigger sequence playing.
